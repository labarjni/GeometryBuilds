# GeometryBuilds
The plugin will allow you to create any buildings from the BlockBench model

<h1>How to create a building from geometry?</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Create a model in https://web.blockbench.net/ consisting of groups that will be called minecraft blocks with a cube (since blockbench replaces repetitions with numbers, the plugin takes this into account, for example: stone1, stone2...)<br><img src='https://github.com/labarjni/GeometryBuilds/blob/master/example.png?raw=true'></li>
  <li>Save the model without textures as Bedrock geometry</li>
  <li>Load the geometry into the plugin data folder /plugin_data/GeometryBuilds/</li>
  <li>Go to the server and write /build [geometry_name], this will create in your place the building that you made in the blockbench</li>
</ul>

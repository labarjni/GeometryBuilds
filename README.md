<h1>How to create a building from geometry?</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Create a bedrock model in BlockBench</li>
  <li>Create a folder with the name of the block and create standard cubes (these are blocks in the game)<br><img src='https://github.com/labarjni/GeometryBuilds/blob/master/example1.png?raw=true'></li>
  <li>Save the model without textures as Bedrock geometry</li>
  <li>Load the geometry into the plugin data folder /plugin_data/GeometryBuilds/</li>
  <li>Go to the server and write /build [geometry_name], this will create in your place the building that you made in the blockbench<br><img src='https://github.com/labarjni/GeometryBuilds/blob/master/example2.png?raw=true'></li>
